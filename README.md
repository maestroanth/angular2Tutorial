############### MY NOTES ANTHONY WALTER 12/6/2016############

Organization of folders we care about are as followed (4 layers) layer 1 (.git folder e2e node_modules libraries, and src)-> layer 2 is in src (typical website files are in here: index.html styles.css app-root is in index.html. make sure each "-root" app has a different prefex besides app!) -> layer 3 is in app folder (or prefix's name) and contains the main app file (called just app.component.ts (main might be an added benefit to name it later)) -> and layer 4 is all the sub-component folders with corresponding name prefixes (so far simple-form folder with simple-form.component.ts inside)
